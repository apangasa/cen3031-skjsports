# SKJSports

## Project Description
Our project will be a web application for the company, SKJ Sports. More specifically, we will be creating a sports blog-style website, with a section for a podcast as well. Some features of the project include allowing readers to review player statistics, by hovering over a player's name or picture. Also, we may choose to upscale the project in the future, by adding a feature that allows users to login to a dashboard, where they can set up players to "follow", and see various trends for the players they select.
