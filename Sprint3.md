## Issues to Address
On the frontend side, 

On the backend side, we planned to tackle issues related to storing ([See issue][i41]) and retrieving ([See issue][i42]) images. Also, various behavior needed to be addressed with regards to subscribers. We planned to create a subscribers table ([See issue][i46]), implement functionality to add ([See issue][i45]) and remove ([See issue][i47]) users to/from it, create a route for the frontend to indicate an unsubscription event ([See issue][i44]), and handle the cases of resubscription when a user is already subscribed ([See issue][i43]) and when they have previously unsubscribed ([See issue][i48]). We also wanted to tackle the player statistics part of the project - one of the first steps in doing so would be web scraping the relevant positions for each soccer player ([See issue][i53]) so that position-relevant statistics could be gathered. Additionally, we wanted to add routes on the server for the frontend to request player ([See issue][i50]) and team ([See issue][i51]) stats.
